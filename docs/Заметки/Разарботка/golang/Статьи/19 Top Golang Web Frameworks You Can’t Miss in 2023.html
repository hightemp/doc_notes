It presents a Martini-like API but delivers upto 40x performance than Martini. It allows for the writing of modular and scalable web applications. Gin has an identical syntax to the Django framework (a renowned Python-based CMS.) It will enable the developers to easily use as many Python libraries as needed to transit into Golang development with little effort. Another added benefit of Gin is that it allows code reusability. Though with these many features, it may seem that Gin doesn’t have any cons. But, its main con is that it is suitable only for smaller web applications.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>: 64.6k Stars</strong></p> <h3 id="beego"><a href="#beego" class="header-anchor">#</a> Beego</h3> <p><img src="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Beego.webp" alt="Beego" title="Beego"></p> <p>Beego is the second most popular Golang framework in our list that allows for faster development of REST APIs, web apps, and backend. It is mainly suitable for enterprise-grade apps and is more centric on them. Beego is often regarded as almost similar to Django in Python and also maintains almost identical characteristics to that of Go, like interfaces and struct embedding. It is not bound by any third-party installations and is a full-fledged MVC framework with its libraries and a built-in Bee Tool that helps find the changes made to the code.</p> <p>The Golang REST API framework, Beego makes it an ideal choice for automated testing and packing. Also, it possesses inbuilt modules like context handling and ORM support which establishes a firm ground for an application.</p> <p>Beego is also segregated into eight modules you can use at your convenience. It integrates an ORM to organize the app database, session handling tools, and logging systems. Beego also involves a cache handler and libraries for operating HTTP elements. Furthermore, it is equally efficient with Command-line tools, which works almost identical to that how Django uses the command line. The main setback of Beego is that it possesses extensive functionality and features, which makes it a tough choice for new product owners.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/beego/beego" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>: 29.1k Stars</strong></p> <h3 id="echo"><a href="#echo" class="header-anchor">#</a> Echo</h3> <p><img src="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Echo.webp" alt="Echo" title="Echo"></p> <p>Echo is another performance-centric, extensible, and minimalist Golang web framework, especially for building microservices.
