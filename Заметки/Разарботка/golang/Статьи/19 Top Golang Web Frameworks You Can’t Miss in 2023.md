## What are Golang Web Frameworks?

**Golang Web Frameworks** allows you to write APIs and web services directly and easily. Talking about the frameworks, they are not a mandate when considering a simple application but become essential when considering some complex application development. However, it was not a long time back when traditional software development was in pace, but the use of frameworks experienced a significant upsurge in the strata. Trailing the same, the product owners also made great efforts to introduce new frameworks with the sole aim of making one better than the other.

These are a few of the most popular Golang frameworks that our developers found significantly better during their web application development journey.

### Gin/Gin-Gonic

![Gin Gonic](https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gin-Gonic.webp "Gin Gonic")

Gin is one of the Top Golang Frameworks in 2023, ideal for creating modular and scalable web apps. It presents a Martini-like API but delivers upto 40x performance than Martini. It allows for the writing of modular and scalable web applications. Gin has an identical syntax to the Django framework (a renowned Python-based CMS.) It will enable the developers to easily use as many Python libraries as needed to transit into Golang development with little effort. Another added benefit of Gin is that it allows code reusability. Though with these many features, it may seem that Gin doesn’t have any cons. But, its main con is that it is suitable only for smaller web applications.

### Beego

![Beego](https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Beego.webp "Beego")

Beego is the second most popular Golang framework in our list that allows for faster development of REST APIs, web apps, and backend. It is mainly suitable for enterprise-grade apps and is more centric on them. Beego is often regarded as almost similar to Django in Python and also maintains almost identical characteristics to that of Go, like interfaces and struct embedding. It is not bound by any third-party installations and is a full-fledged MVC framework with its libraries and a built-in Bee Tool that helps find the changes made to the code.

The Golang REST API framework, Beego makes it an ideal choice for automated testing and packing. Also, it possesses inbuilt modules like context handling and ORM support which establishes a firm ground for an application.

Beego is also segregated into eight modules you can use at your convenience. It integrates an ORM to organize the app database, session handling tools, and logging systems. Beego also involves a cache handler and libraries for operating HTTP elements. Furthermore, it is equally efficient with Command-line tools, which works almost identical to that how Django uses the command line. The main setback of Beego is that it possesses extensive functionality and features, which makes it a tough choice for new product owners.

### Echo

![Echo](https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Echo.webp "Echo")

Echo is another performance-centric, extensible, and minimalist Golang web framework, especially for building microservices. Echo is great for creating APIs, JSON web services, and RESTFUL APIs. You can use Echo as a standalone framework or combine it with other libraries like gin. Echo presents a number of features like Data Binding and Rendering, Automatic TLS, Extensibility, HTTP/2 support, Scalability, Middlewares, Optimized Router, Templating, and others but the one main flaw of Echo is that it lacks frequent code updates and that it is maintained by only one developer.

### Kit

![GoKit](https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GoKit.webp "GoKit")

Go kit is a toolkit mainly for microservices in Golang, but you can also use it simply for elegant monoliths. Go kit involves a few best practices that present a comprehensive and reliable method of creating microservices irrespective of the organization’s size. Kit has multi-correlated packages that collectively present an opinionated framework for building large service-oriented architectures, making Go an ideal choice for writing microservices.

Though Go is a general-purpose language, the microservices offer a specific intensity of specialized support. The kit actually presents RPC or Remote Procedure Calls safety, infrastructure integration, and system observability. It was designed for interoperability, and the product owners can choose the architecture, platforms, databases, and components that act in the ideal sense for them. The disadvantage of using go-kit is that its hefty interface use, and the overhead adding of API to the service is lofty.

It presents a rapid HTTP server as well as a client API. Fast HTTP is introduced as an alternative to net/HTTTP because of the optimization. It is optimized for speed and can simultaneously interact with more than 100k queries per second and more than 1 Million concurrent keep-alive connections on modern hardware. Fast HTTP has low memory usage, with easy ‘Connection Upgrade’ support via RequestCtx.Hijack. The Client supports automatic retry on idempotent requests’ failure.

Furthermore, the Fasthttp API is intended to possess the ability to extend existing Client as well as server implementations or to write custom client and server implementations from scratch. But, as the net/HTTPS possesses more audience, it is more reliable and tested. Also, both net/http and fast/https are incompatible with each other and hence, it is often tedious for product owners to migrate from net/http to fast/http

### Net/HTTP

If you are amongst those who read the Go mailing lists, then Net/HTTP is the apt framework for you. The product owners generally prefer developing their entire XMPP server with HTTP or net, which functions appropriately even after that. However, we know that complex web apps need middleware.

Also, several options allow you to mix and match middleware from other Go frameworks that possess the standard HTTP or net. Nevertheless, it features a restricted interface, and no standard way of maximizing middleware is defined. The routing is not so powerful, so you use a framework along with it.
