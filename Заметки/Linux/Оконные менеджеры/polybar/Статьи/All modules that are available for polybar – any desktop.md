# All modules that are available for polybar – any desktop

ICONS IN POLYBAR

The little icons you see in the polybar are defined by the font **awesome-terminal-fonts**. Changing the icons could not be easier. Surf to the website and copy/paste the icon you would like to have to your polybar config.

On this page we are going over the many modules we provide one by one. We test them out and sometimes improve them in place. So you learn how to change the modules to your liking.

Each desktop has its own desktop bar called either

-   mainbar-i3
-   mainbar-openbox
-   mainbar-openbox-extra
-   mainbar-bspwm

Each of these mainbars has these 3 lines to tell what modules you would like to see.

-   modules-left
-   modules-center
-   modules-right

You will be editing these lines the most.

You define what modules you want to see in those lines.

BACKLIGHT-ACPI

No documentation on wiki yet. Guessing you can use the same config as on **xbacklight.  
Xbacklight** seems to be the promoted module  for this function.

BACKLIGHT

**Not favored any more.** **Xbacklight** is the new module replacing this one.
